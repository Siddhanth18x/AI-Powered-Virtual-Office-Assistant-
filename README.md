# AI-Powered-Virtual-Office-Assistant-
The Smart Virtual Office Assistant is an intelligent, AI-driven web application designed to
enhance workplace productivity and streamline daily office operations. Built using Java
Spring Boot for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and MySQL for secure data storage,
the system integrates with Azure OpenAI to provide natural, context-aware assistance.
It allows employees to interact with an AI chatbot for managing tasks, scheduling meetings,
retrieving company policies, and generating professional documents — all through
conversational commands. The admin can manage users, FAQs, meeting data, and analyze
system usage via a secure dashboard.
By combining enterprise automation with AI-powered communication, this application
acts as a virtual coworker — intelligent, responsive, and always available.
